\usage{
clusterExpr(se, cvExpr, threshold = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A SummarizedExperiment containing the normalised gene expression data.}

\item{cvExpr}{The output from cvExpr.}

\item{threshold}{Optional. The quantile threshold of genes to be used for clustering analaysis. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
Returns a SummarizedExperiment containing the original inputted se, but where an additional column labelled Ploidy has been added into the meta data containing the classification of each sample.
}
\description{
Performs a partitioning clustering analysis in order to predict which samples have an enrichment for a genomic region of interest.
}
\details{
Performs a partitioning clustering to predict which samples have a genomic duplication or deletion of a genomic region of interest.
Samples are labelled Hyperploidy or Hypoploidy with respect to one another which are arbitrary labels referring to an enrichment or loss of genomic region.
